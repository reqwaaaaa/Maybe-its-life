# Maybe It's Life

- Even if you know the glorious sun will not rise tomorrow,  
- Even if the bright moon sinks beneath the vast ocean,  
- Even if you foresee the inevitable tides of the world,  
- Even if the end leaves nothing but ashes,
  
You will never lose heart, but instead face it all with unyielding determination and an indomitable spirit.

***This repository serves as a place where I document my study notes and reflections on life. I hope that through this journey, I may continue to grow, learn, and discover meaning. Wish you luck!***

<!-- 
即便你知道辉煌的朝阳不会在明天升起，  
即便皎洁的月亮沉没在浩瀚的海洋之下，  
即便你预见了世界不可逆转的潮流，  
即便最终的一切化为灰烬，  
你依然不会失去勇气，而是以坚定的决心与不屈的精神去面对这一切。
